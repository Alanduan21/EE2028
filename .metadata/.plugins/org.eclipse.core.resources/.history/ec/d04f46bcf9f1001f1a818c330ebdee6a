@ write your program from here:

asm_func:
 	PUSH {R4-R9,R14}
 	@my code

	MOV R6, #6 @counter for summing up all entries
	MOV R7, #0
LOOP1:
		LDR R4, [R1], #4 @ load entries to R4
		ADD R7, R4 @ R7 is SUM of total entries
		SUBS R6, #1
		BNE LOOP1

	MOV R6, #6 @COUNTER
	MOV R8, #12
LOOP2:
		LDR R4, [R0], #4 @load the no. of cars in each section to R4
		LDR R9, [R2], #4 @load the no, of cars exit in each section to R9
		SUB R5, R8, R4 @compute the remaining space in each section, value in R5
		CMP R7, R5 @compare entry and remaining space
		ITTTEE MI @if entry < remaining
		ADDMI R4, R7 @all remaining entering cars enter the current section, no. of car after entry in R4
		SUBMI R4, R9 @final result after subtract exits in each section in R4
		MOVMI R7, #0 @ clear SUM
		SUBPL R4, R8, R9 @final result after subtract exits in each section in R4
		SUBPL R7, R5 @update no. of cars that haven't entered


		SUB R6, #1
		STR R4, [R3], #4 @store result
		BNE LOOP2

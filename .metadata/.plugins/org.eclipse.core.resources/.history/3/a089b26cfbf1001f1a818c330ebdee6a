@ write your program from here:

asm_func:
 	PUSH {R4-R9,R14}
 	@my code

	MOV R6, #6 @ counter
	MOV R7, #0
LOOP1:
		LDR R4, [R1], #4 @ load entries to R4
		ADD R7, R4 @ R7 is SUM of total entries
		SUBS R6, #1
		BNE LOOP1

	MOV R6, #6  @ counter
	MOV R8, #12 @ LIMIT
LOOP2:
		LDR R4, [R0], #4 @ section amount NO.
		LDR R9, [R2], #4 @ each section's EXIT
		SUB R5, R8, R4 @ R5 is LEFT_WITH
		CMP R7, R5 @ compare SUM-LEFT_WITH
		ITTTEE MI @ if SUM < LEFT_WITH
		ADDMI R4, R7 @ all SUM remained enter current section
		SUBMI R4, R9 @ result after substracting EXIT
		MOVMI R7, #0 @ clear SUM
		SUBPL R4, R8, R9 @ 12-EXIT stored in R4
		SUBPL R7, R5 @update no. of cars that haven't entered


		SUB R6, #1
		STR R4, [R3], #4 @store result
		BNE LOOP2

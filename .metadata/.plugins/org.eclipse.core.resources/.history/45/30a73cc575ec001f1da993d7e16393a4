@ Look-up table for registers:

@ R0: building (pointer)
@ R1: entry (pointer)
@ R2: exit (pointer)
@ R3: result (pointer)
@ R4: f loop i
@ R5: s loop j
@ R6: entry[k]
@ R7:
@ R8:
@ R9:
@ R10:

@ write your program from here:

asm_func:
 	PUSH {R0-R8,R14} @ right now I am using R0-R8, might need more

	LDR






	BL SUBROUTINE @ jump to subroutine

@ go back to main.c
 	POP {R14}

	BX LR

SUBROUTINE:

	BX LR
